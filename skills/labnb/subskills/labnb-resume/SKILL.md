# Resume From Index

Use this subskill before starting new lab notebook work for a project.

## Guardrails

1. Respect any parent constitution, project policy, or task-level write constraint already in scope.
2. Review those rules before deciding whether to resume, branch, or start fresh.
3. Prefer the safer pickup point when two choices would create competing writes to the same source tree.
4. Review status and provenance for matching entries before choosing where to pick up.
5. Treat provenance as best-effort; external changes may exist outside labnb tracking.
6. When reading provenance, expect W3C PROV-O terms rather than custom event keys.

## Flow

1. Resolve the lab root.
2. Review the parent constitution and local project guardrails.
3. Derive the project slug.
4. Run:

```bash
python skills/labnb/scripts/summarize_index.py \
  --lab-root "$LAB_ROOT" \
  --project-slug "$PROJECT_SLUG"
```

5. Summarize:
   - relevant ideas
   - active experiments
   - completed experiments worth branching from
   - the best current pickup point
6. Choose one path:
   - resume an active experiment
   - promote an idea into a new experiment
   - create a child experiment from prior work
   - register a new idea or experiment

Do not skip this step when the user is asking to start or continue lab notebook work.
