"""Validate NER spans against the source text.

After extraction (and especially after merging chunk results), every entity's
start/end must satisfy `text[start:end] == entity`. That is the one hard invariant;
everything else here is about not throwing away good items while enforcing it.

Two things this module deliberately does NOT assume:

**A span may cross sentence boundaries.** The `sentence` field is a *context window*,
not a single grammatical sentence. Gold-standard cell annotations put roughly a
quarter of spans across sentence boundaries even after sentence segmentation is
cleaned up (measured: 31.2% of gold spans looked multi-sentence with a naive splitter,
23.0% with a good one — so a fifth of them are genuinely multi-sentence, not artifacts).
An earlier version rejected any item whose surface was not a substring of `sentence`,
which silently deleted exactly that class: the extractor did its job, the window held
one of the sentences, and the item vanished with no diagnostic.

**Substring membership is not location.** `sentence in text` and `surface in sentence`
can both be true while the offsets point somewhere else entirely — common when a cell
name or a boilerplate sentence repeats, which in these papers is constant. Anchoring is
checked by offset, and `sentence` is only used as a *hint* for repair.
